# Grand Ave Crash Data Analysis

This Clay Notebook project is designed to process and analyze California's crash data (CCRS) with a focus on specific areas and time periods. Our primary goals are to analyze trends on Telegraph Ave before and after the implementation of traffic calming measures and to examine current crash patterns on Grand Ave, including the affected demographics.

## Project Goals

1. **Process Californiaâ€™s Crash Data (CCRS)**:
   - Analyze trends on Telegraph Ave before and after traffic calming measures were implemented.

2. **Examine Current Crash Patterns on Grand Ave**:
   - Investigate the affected demographics, such as age groups.

3. **Visualize and Interpret Findings**:
   - Create visualizations to help interpret the analyzed data and present the findings in an understandable manner.


## Current Status:
- CSV files with the Oakland-only data are saved in the project.
- some basic "figure out how to make graphs" stuff has happened.

## Immediate goals:
- Define the Telegraph Ave project (what section of the street do we want to look at?)
- Look at Telegraph Ave before/after the project

What might be difficult to accomplish in the time frame?

Are we still helpful for my friends?
What might be the story here?
Do we have a method to notice some places where there has been an increase compared to the whole city?

Model for a local count? probabilistic/statistical models. compare to the city. 
Ratio of decrease overall, vs ration of degrees on Telegraph.

What percentage of the injuries are on telegraph?
Could try to localize the peaks? Near schools?

Time series compares to the city and what it means
Come up with some questions to challenge tools, 

Looking into ratios (local count/city)
What visualization do we want?
Given a point in the city- open an iframe with a street view. usability of the storytelling

Local questions?
The story is the important part.
