# Grand Ave Crash Data Analysis

This Clay Notebook project is designed to process and analyze California's crash data (CCRS) with a focus on specific areas and time periods. Our primary goals are to analyze trends on Telegraph Ave before and after the implementation of traffic calming measures and to examine current crash patterns on Grand Ave, including the affected demographics.

## Project Goals

1. **Process Californiaâ€™s Crash Data (CCRS)**: 
   - Analyze trends on Telegraph Ave before and after traffic calming measures were implemented.
  
2. **Examine Current Crash Patterns on Grand Ave**:
   - Investigate the affected demographics, such as age groups.

3. **Visualize and Interpret Findings**:
   - Create visualizations to help interpret the analyzed data and present the findings in an understandable manner.


## Current Status:
- CSV files with the Oakland-only data are saved in the project.
- some basic "figure out how to make graphs" stuff has happened.

## Immediate goals:
- Define the Telegraph Ave project (what section of the street do we want to look at?)
- Look at Telegraph Ave before/after the project
